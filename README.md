# 🍽️ Food Picker

A mobile-first, interactive **food decision helper** built with React.

Food Picker helps users break indecision by allowing them to add food or restaurant choices, spin a roulette-style wheel, and receive a random result instantly.

## 🎮 App Overview

Food Picker turns a common problem — *“What should we eat?”* — into a simple and fun experience.

The app is designed primarily for **mobile devices**, with full desktop support.

This page shows the current list of choices and prepares users for adding more.

## ➕ Adding Food Choices

Users can enter custom food or restaurant options using a simple input interface.

There is no limit to how many options can be added, keeping the experience flexible and user-driven.

## ▶️ Entering the Spin Zone

Once the list is ready, users proceed to the spin zone.
